## Bug explanation

When adding a complex object to a list, we don't want any fields of this object to be populated unless they have some defaultValue set. This goes even more important for the lists that must be populated by user.

Imagine we have a list of documents that user should upload. For each document he should fill in a country name document is related to; and upload a photo of document. We store files in `documents` Array field as list of String file ids. So we create this two schemas:

```js
// single object schema
const schema2a = new SimpleSchema({
    country: String,
    documents: {
        type: Array,
        minCount: 1,
    },
    "documents.$": String,
});

// form schema
const schema2 = new SimpleSchema({
    passport: {
      type: Array,
      label: "Passport",
      minCount: 1,
    },
    "passport.$": {
      type: schema2a,
      label: "Passport #",
    },
});
```

When we add new document to list of documents, it should be unpopulated. But somehow `documents` field for newly created object contains one undefined value. Then on Submit click it passes validation. And that is wrong.
